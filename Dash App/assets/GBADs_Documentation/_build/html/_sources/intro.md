# Welcome to the Animal Health Loss Envelope Interactive Case Study Dashboard

This interactive dashboard allows users to explore the results of models that use publicly available data and expert elicitation to produce country-specific estimates of the burden of animal diseases.

To view livestock populations by country, see the GBADs [population dashboard](https://gbadske.org/dashboards/population/). To view populations by region within Ethiopia, see the GBADs [Ethiopia subnational population dashboard](https://gbadske.org/dashboards/ethiopia-population/).

This is part of the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) project. To learn more, see [the GBADs webpage](https://animalhealthmetrics.org/). To browse other dashboards and data sources hosted by the GBADs Informatics theme, see [the GBADs Knowledge Engine](http://gbadske.org/).
