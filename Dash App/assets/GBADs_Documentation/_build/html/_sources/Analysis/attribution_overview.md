# Attribution

Attribution to infectious, non-infectious, and external causes is based on proportions from expert elicitation. See the Expert Opinion Attribution Proportions table for the results of expert elicitation.

Experts were asked to estimate the proportions of mortality and production losses attributable to each cause. They were not asked to estimate the health expenditure associated with each cause because many health-related expenditures are beneficial to all causes. Therefore, health cost attribution is only approximate. In Ethiopia, health expenditures are very small compared to mortality and production losses, so these generally do not appear in the treemap.

Attribution to specific diseases such as Brucellosis is estimated by running the compartmental herd model with disease-specific scenarios, using parameters that reflect the impact of that disease on the population (such as increased mortality, decreased growth rate, or decreased lactation).
