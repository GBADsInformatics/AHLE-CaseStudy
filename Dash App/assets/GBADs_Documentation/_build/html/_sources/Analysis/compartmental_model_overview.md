# Compartmental herd model

The herd dynamics model is a compartmental model in which the herd (livestock population) are divided by sex and age classes. Each sex class (male and female) is classified into three age groups (neonate, juvenile and adult) resulting in six sex-age groups. The model simulates the herd dynamics based on demographic (birth and death rates) and offtake rates in a monthly time step for one year.

The simulation of the model produces annual production offtakes (live animal, milk, draft power, hides, manure etc.) and their respective monetary values (revenue) based on prices for these production outputs. It also estimates the change in total expenditure on production inputs: feed, labor and animal health care. The revenue and costs from the herd model enable the calculation of gross margins for the simulated populations.

The gross margin is calculated for different scenarios formed by combination of sex-age groups, production systems and incremental improvement in health statuses.
