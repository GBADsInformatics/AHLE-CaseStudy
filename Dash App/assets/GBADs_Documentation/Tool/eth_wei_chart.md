# Wider economic impact

The wider economic impact charts show the change in live animal production and the estimated increases in national GDP and economic surplus for two scenarios:
- Zero mortality: where mortality has been eliminated
- Ideal: where mortality and production losses due to disease have been eliminated

Note: these are currently limited to showing the impact of disease in cattle and small ruminants.
