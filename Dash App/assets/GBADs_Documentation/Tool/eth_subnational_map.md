# AHLE Subnational map

The map shows the animal health loss envelope for each subnational state of Ethiopia.

Use the Item dropdown to select a metric to display. Any of the revenue or cost items can be selected, and the current value will be shown for each region. The default display is the Animal Health Loss Envelope, which is the difference between current and ideal gross margin for each region.
