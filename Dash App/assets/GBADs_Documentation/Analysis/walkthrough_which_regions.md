# Which regions of the country are most impacted by disease?

We can address this using the map on the AHLE tab with the Item display set to "Animal Health Loss Envelope" (the default). This displays the difference in gross margin between the current and ideal scenarios. We can use this to compare either total value or value per kg biomass between regions.

Note: subnational estimates are currently only available for cattle, so this example is limited to comparing regional losses in cattle.
