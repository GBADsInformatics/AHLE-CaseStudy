# Attribution

Attribution to infectious, non-infectious, and external causes is based on proportions from expert elicitation. See the Expert Opinion Attribution Proportions table for the estimates provided by individual experts.

Experts were asked to estimate the proportions of mortality and production losses attributable to each cause. These proportions were also applied to health costs. Health cost attribution is only approximate because many health-related expenditures are not cause-specific. In Ethiopia, health expenditures are very small compared to mortality and production losses.

The impact of each specific disease, such as Brucellosis, is estimated by modifying the parameters from the ideal scenario with the expected impact of that disease on the base population parameters (such as increased mortality, decreased growth rate, or decreased lactation) and running it through the compartmental herd model.
