# Which diseases have the largest impact on animal health loss?

We can address this using the attribution treemap. Note that we are setting some of the segmentation variables to None to simplify the display.

**First, we show the impacts of infectious, non-infectious, and external causes.**

```{figure} ../Images/attribution_causes_annotated.png

#height: 700px
name: attribution_causes_annotated
---
Showing the impacts of infectious, non-infectious, and external causes over all species
```

**Next, we show the impacts of specific infectious diseases.**

name: attribution_inf_diseases_annotated
---
Showing the impacts of specific infectious diseases
```

**We can also show this for specific species.**

name: attribution_cattle_annotated

Showing the impacts of specific infectious diseases for cattle
```
