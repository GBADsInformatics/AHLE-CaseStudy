# GBADs AHLE Case Study Dashboard

This repository houses the code to estimate the animal health loss envelope for country-specific case studies. 

It was created based on the Ethiopia case study, originally stored within the GBADsLiverpool repository, from the AHLE Dashboard.

The goal is for this dashboard to be a template for other country case studies. As long as a country's data mimics the existing structure of the Ethiopia data, you should be able to add that country into the dashboard with light adjustments.
